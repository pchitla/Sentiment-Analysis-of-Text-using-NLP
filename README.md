# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Text-using-NLP

For this project, I worked on understanding whether a text/tweet has a positive or a negative sentiment using NLTK Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# Data

Data can be any text for which you want to identify if the sentiment of that text is Negative or Positive. I have taken some text from the website and stored in a file and then tried to analyse sentiments of the text.

# Conclusion

The final outcome of my text is positive.
